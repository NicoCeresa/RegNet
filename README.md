# RegNet
Implimentation of the RegNet paper that proposes a modification to the ResNet architecture. This modification consists of an addition all convolutional RNN that increases the extraction of spatio-temporal information. The results of this paper are promising as this architecture increases the accuracy by 1.51% on CIFAR-10 and 2.04% on CIFAR-100
